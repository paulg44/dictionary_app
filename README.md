# Welcome to this online dictionary

I decided to create an online dictionary to tests my skills at Javascript and fetching an API while parsing different parts of data from it. I will also include some tests as to keep on practising them.
Here I will document what I learnt along the way.

The html and css are very basic so I'll not speak too much about them.

# Learnings

I learned alot about how async functions work in this project, I was struggling to make the value of the input and the API link together. I then realised that the eventLIstener functions needed to be async as to not run straight away.
I also learnt how important the order of things inside a function are, needing the eventListeners at the top of the function before the API is called.
I also learnt how to pick the specific data I wanted from the API, not too difficult with this API so was great to learn from.

I had adjective and adverb in the definitions also, however are have commented them out as they are not that popular and replaced them with the audio of the phonetic

# Testing

I have used playwright for testing as it's currently the one I am most comfortable with
